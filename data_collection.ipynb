    "<img src='./images/divskinny.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This app was created to help TikTok creators monitor the top and rising songs and hashtags by country/location. This is important due to the way that TikTok algorithm selects For You Page (FYP)  content for its users in 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why does location matter?\n",
    "If TikTok a creator has fewer than [???](https:///www.google.com) followers, their videos are only recommended on the For You Pages of users in their OWN country. \n",
    "This means that until creators have a large enough following, they need to prioritize creating locally targeted content until they reach the minimum following threshold to be suggested internationally.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is this a problem?\n",
    "**This limitation makes it difficult for new creators to significantly expand their reach or increase their number of followers, especially if they are making niche content and most of their target audience lives outside of their home country.  For example:** <br />\n",
    "* The majority of users within your business niche or industry live in a different country than you. You are making industry relevant content but it is not recommended to your target  audience due to the location restrictions. You struggle to gain enough followers to be suggested internationally.\n",
    "* You are using TikTok for your business, so you only follow industry related accounts - most of which are located in a different country than you. As a result, you see content from your country less frequently and lose exposure to local trends. You begin making content with trending sounds and hashtags from the wrong locality, and struggle to get views.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Changing your location</u>\n",
    "**TikTok determines location of a user or creator based on THREE pieces of information:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Their GPS location\n",
    "2. their IP address\n",
    "3. their SIM card\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use a VPN and change the GPS location on your phone, this may change what your location is *displayed as* in your user settings and profile. **However, fully modifying your location internally requires [Having multiple SIM cards for diff countries, hardware requirements,  etc etc link.](https://www.google.com)** In short, they have made it as difficult as possible.\n"

    "<img src='./images/divskinny.png'><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "**For creators who don't have the time, money, or desire to manage multiple devices and SIM cards, a solution is needed. As of Feb 2022 there was not an app that allowed users to see  worldwide trends on TikTok (However there were apps for select countries, such as the USA and Malaysia.) For other countries, the only way to get this information is to make multiple TikTok accounts for each country/industry pair, follow relevant accounts/hashtags, train the algorithm to show you more of what you want to see, and draw your own conclusions by scrolling regularly. This is time consuming.** \n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### My intention is to design an app that could answer the following questions for a creator/business owner:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the top trending sounds in <code>country 1</code>?\n",
    "2. What is the intersection of top trending sounds/hashtags in <code>country 1</code>, <code>country 2</code>, and <code>country 3</code>? \n",
    "3. What are the top trending sounds for users living in  <code>country 1</code>  who follow <code>hashtag 1</code>?\n",
    "4. What are the top trending sounds and hashtags for all users in <code>country 1</code> who follow <code>influencer account 1</code>?\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You're following a lot of international accounts and want to double check that the trends you're using are relevant for your reach level.\n",
    "* You want to isolate tiktok trends in both your industry/niche AND your country, to fine tune content for the *accessible* part of your target audience.\n",
    "* You want to cross reference TikTok trends from multiple countries at once in order to increase views in all of them.\n",
    "* You need a very quick source of info on TikTok trends in a different country.\n",
    "\n",
    "*This project was created with #DataTok and Australia in mind, so prototype app will prioritize delivering stats for these two categories.*\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Bonus Research Questions*\n",
    "\n",
    "The location based limits were put in place in order to ensure that users would see content that was relevant and understandable to them. There are many cases where it's detrimental, and keeps users from seeing content that's a good fit for their interests and culture. For example - content being uploaded by Toronto-based creators is probably relevant, relatable, and understandable to users living in northern Michigan.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>If there's time, I'll explore alternative clustering models to create clusters of users, without using their country as a defining characteristic.</font>\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risks & assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since primary use of this app will be for analysis, there are not as many risks or assumptions made.\n",
    "* However, TikTok changes their algorithms often - so usefulness/relevancy of this information may decrease over time.\n",
    "* Risks and assumptions will be discussed separately for modeling section.\n",
